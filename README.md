### Setup the development environment ###

The Python version using on development is 3.7.6. We strongly recommend using the pyenv virtualenv to create the development environment.

If you are not familiar with pyenv or either don't have it installed, take a look here.

1. Make sure that you have the Python 3.7.6 version install on your computer. If you don't have it, you can use the pyenv to install it:

```
pyenv install 3.7.6
```

2. After the Python is installed, you can create the virtual environment for the project, using:

```
pyenv virtualenv 3.7.6 kimaris
```

3. After the virtual environment is created, you will use the following to activate it:

```
pyenv activate kimaris
```

4. Now you can install the project dependencies with the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
